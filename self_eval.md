# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    I am comfortable running the few we have gone over in class. If I need to use one that I don't have memorized I'm going to be using the ruby doc for that.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

    I felt like I did a pretty good job writing my own methods. I didn't struggle with them too much. I found that as long as I keep my syntax correct I can make the method do just about anything. 

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

    It seems like you could write a method for anything, could you write an entire program with just a single method if all the arugments, parameters, etc. were captured?
